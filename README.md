# Find-Digits--Algo

This problem where for a given integer n, the task is to count how many of its digits evenly divide n. The main function reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads an integer n, calls the findDigits function (which is yet to be implemented), and writes the result to an output file. The helper functions ltrim and rtrim are used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from input strings to ensure clean parsing. The actual logic for counting the digits that divide n will be implemented inside the findDigits function.
